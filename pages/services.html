		<h2>Implementation</h2>
		<p>Beruff & Company is ready to help you to implement strategic recommendations as a trusted partner bringing a fresh perspective, focused energy, and rapid implementation. We identify and evaluate optimal means of implementation, including the creation of a separate entity jointly owned by the client and Beruff & Company to deploy the recommendation and realize the business potential.</p>

		<p>Based on the clientâ€™s preferences, Beruff & Company will consider implementation assignments in which the risk is shared with the client.  These jointly owned entities could be re-purchased by clients at an agreed-upon formula price or sold to strategic buyers to harvest value.  Areas that are typically considered for this type of implementation include the commercialization of new products or services and the deployment of new operating models.</p>
